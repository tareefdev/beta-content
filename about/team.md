The team working on the Syrian Archive is uniquely comprised of researchers, journalists, technologists and digital security experts who have been working in the field of human rights, verification, open source technologies and investigation methodologies for the past ten years. They are motivated in their mission to enable various stakeholders such as lawyers, journalists and activists, to be able to find, store and use publicly available content to not only document human rights violations but also to be able to use this content to prosecute those both perpetrating and enabling these crimes.

Hadi has previously worked with Tactical Technology Collective for the last 5 years to support journalists and news agencies in securing their data, devices and communications online.
