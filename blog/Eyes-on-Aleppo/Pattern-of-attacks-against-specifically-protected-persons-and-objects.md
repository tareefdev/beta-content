## Mosques

Mosques are a specially protected object under IHL, which states that "It is prohibited to commit an act of hostility directed against places of worship \[including mosques\] which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples." A map of violations against mosques is provided below:

In February 2017 UN OHCHR report on Aleppo, only one attack against a mosque was identified, occurring on 19 August at approximately 5PM in the Salah al-Din district of Aleppo. OHCHR attributed the attack on Abdulqader Shasho school and the attached mosque to either Russian or Syrian air strikes. While the school and mosque was not in session during this time, four adults were wounded during the attack. For this incident, the Syrian Archive was unable to locate any video documentation.

The Syrian Archive was, however, able collect and verify evidence of four (4) other attacks against mosques occurring in Aleppo during the July - December 2016 period. Video footage is available on the Syrian Archive website, and a table highlighting available incidents and associated metadata is available in the Appendix to this report.

The first incident identified by the Syrian Archive was an attack on the Grand Mosque in Anadan city, Aleppo, occurring on 6 September. For this incident, the Syrian Archive has collected and verified two videos. A few days later on 10 September, the Grand Mosque of Batbo, Aleppo, and separately, the "Abu Ubaidah al Jarrah" mosque in Sukkari, Aleppo were both attacked. The Syrian Archive has collected and verified one video for each of these two incidents.

For this incident, the Syrian Archive has collected and verified one video.

Schools are a specially protected object under IHL, paragraph 22 of which states that they may only be the object of attack \"when used for military purposes, and such attacks require prior warning when the school is located in a densely populated civilian area. In the February 2017 UN OHCHR report on Aleppo, four (4) incidents against schools were identified.

In this incident the Abdulqader Shasho school and attached mosque were targeted. While the school was not in session during this time, four adults were injured in the attack.

In early September, the relocated Abdulqader Shasho school was hit by an airstrike while classes were in session. Nine elementary school students were killed during the attack and dozens more were wounded. For this incident the Syrian Archive has not yet been able to collect or verify any video documentation.

Indirect mortar projectiles killed at least two female students at the Aleppo University Faculty of Humanities in Al-Farqan district. As of the date of this publication, the Syrian Archive has not yet been able to collect or verify any video documentation for this incident. An additional attack was identified as occurring on 20 November, shortly before 11AM, in which unguided rockets were directed towards Al-Furqan district, striking an elementary school and killing at least seven children. For this incident, the Syrian Archive has not yet been able to collect or verify any video documentation, as of the date of this publication.

The February 2017 OHCHR report on the situation in Aleppo found several incidents of attacks against bakeries. Attacks on bakeries or other food sources are unlawful under rule 54 of International Humanitarian Law, which prohibits attacks against objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, which it defines as including but not limited to foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation works.

On 28 September, the report found that an attack by either Syrian or Russian air forces occurred at approximately 3AM before morning prayers on a bakery in al-Maadi district while inhabitants lined up for bread.

## Hospitals

Much has been written about attacks against hospitals in Aleppo city in the Atlantic Council and UN OHCHR reports. For this reason, and in order to not duplicate findings, while this report will mention specific incidents when relevant, deeper analysis will not be provided in this report. Attacks against hospitals are illegal under International Humanitarian Law as they fall under the category of specially protected persons and objects.

Incidents occurring in the Aleppo countryside, however, have not been focused extensively in existing reports, and will form the bulk of this section. An analysis of 43 collected and verified videos by the Syrian Archive found a total number of eleven (11) incidents in which hospitals were attacked.

On 14 July in Kafr Hamrah, Aleppo, an attack on the only hospital left it permanently out of service. For this incident, the Syrian Archive has collected and verified four (4) videos.

Two days later on 16 July, an attack against the Omar bin AbdulAziz hospital in Ma'adi, Aleppo was found to have occurred. For this incident, the Syrian Archive has collected and verified three (3) videos. The Syrian Archive has additionally created a 3D video showing damage to the Omar Bin AbdulAziz hospital through a process of scanning and processing digital images from one of the videos. See below:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EJUuhRN4KA" width="660" height="415" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The 3D structure helped to identify details in the room unseen in a normal video, such as viewing objects at various angles. This methodology has the potential to assist in future verification work in other contexts.

The following week on 23 July, an attack on Al-Daqa hospital as a result of Russian or Syrian Airstrikes was found to have occurred in Alshaar, Aleppo. For this incident, the Syrian Archive has collected and verified one (1) video. The week following this incident, on 31 July, a hospital was attacked in Anadan, Aleppo as a result of airstrikes.

## Arbitrary arrest and unlawful detention

There are several reports of civilians being detained or [prevented](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/aleppo-crisis-latest-rebel-assad-blame-un-lack-evacuations-a7374081.html) from evacuating Aleppo. Syrian and Russian forces claimed that rebel groups were preventing people from evacuating, and rebel groups claimed that Syrian and Russian forces controlled checkpoints.

In December 2016, Syrian government forces made advances into eastern Aleppo, forcing thousands of women, men and children out of their homes. Many people were reported to be disappeared during the evacuation. Among them includes AbdulHadi Kamel, a volunteer rescue worker with the Syrian Civil Defense. After his disappearance, [Amnesty International began a campaign](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/01/man-missing-during-east-aleppo-evacuation/) to locate and release him.

In [one leaked video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlL8660ZViQ) of an evacuation obtained by the Syrian Archive, soldiers in military uniforms can be seen searching and detaining evacuated civilians, asking them to remove clothing and lay on the ground. Some detainees appear to have hoods covering their faces.

The soldiers are heard speaking in Syrian and Lebanese dialect. The [video has been geolocated](https://goo.gl/maps/A3sqZ2G4Raw)next to Al Ramousah roundabout and 1070 apartments project and though based on witness testimony has been dated to 16 December 2016.

![Aleppo\_evacuation\_2](/assets/Aleppo_evacuation_2.jpg)

In this [witness testimony video taken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLN0vOwS4Og) by Aleppo Media Center, Ebrahim Abu Al leith mentions that during the evacuation on 16 December 2016 he was detailed while traveling on a bus to Aleppo countryside. The bus was stopped between Al Ramousa roundabout and 1070 apartments project as seen in the video below:

![Cameralocationofleakedvideo](/assets/Cameralocationofleakedvideo.jpg)

This confirms what has is shown in the first leaked video, as it is in the same location as the second video. In the second video, Ebrahim mentioned the presence of Hezbollah forces in the location, confirming the Lebanese accent from the first leaked video.

Ebrahim also mentions that men and young boys were asked to leave the buses and get on the ground, as seen in the first leaked video. He also mentions that some people were executed by the army and that soldiers in the Syrian army or Hezbollah militia were recording video on their smart phones. What is clear from this video is that in this particular incident, government forces introduced barriers to easy evacuation.
