This report has been written jointly by the following organisations:

### Syrian Archive

The [Syrian Archive][1] is a Syrian-led initiative striving to promote sustainable peace and respect for human rights within Syrian society through facilitating justice and accountability efforts. This includes evidence gathering and documentation of incidents; the acknowledgment that war crimes and human rights violations have been committed by all parties to the conflict; the identification of perpetrators to end the cycle of impunity; and the development of a process of justice and reconciliation. Through collecting, verifying, curating and investigating visual content, the Syrian Archive aims to preserve data as a digital memory to establish a database of human rights violations, and to act as a tool for legally implementing justice and accountability efforts as concept and practice in Syria.

Since its founding in 2014, the Syrian Archive have collaborated with organisations including Human Rights Watch (HRW), Amnesty International, Human Rights Center at UC Berkeley School of Law, and Essex University, Witness, Bellingcat and various agencies of the United Nations (UN), specifically the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic.

### Syrians for Truth and Justice

[Syrians for Truth and Justice][2] is an Syria-based independent, non-governmental organization whose members include Syrian human rights defenders, advocates and academics of different backgrounds and nationalities. The initiative strives for Syria, where all Syrian citizens (males and females) have dignity, equality, justice and equal human rights.

### Justice for Life

[Justice for Life][3] is a Syria-based civil society and a non-governmental non-profit organization concerned with strengthening and promoting the culture of human rights in Syria. The organisation is based in Deir Ezzor province. Justice for Life aims to contribute to the implementation and promotion of human rights culture and to the supporting of activists in this area - informing citizens of their civil and political rights and emphasizing the concept of "the rule of law" and its role in community development. Justice for Life has successfully implemented research and advocacy investigations with the goal of building an evidence base of human rights violations. Since its founding in 2013, the group has grown to include a staff of 45 volunteers.
