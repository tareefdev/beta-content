While attacks on medical facilities in Idlib during April 2017 were the focus of this report, many other medical facilities were attacked in Hama during the same period, and throughout the country over the last six years. The investigation of attacks on other medical facilities is the subject of further research.

Through using a variety of sources to corroborate verified visual content, the Syrian Archive aims to additionally provide a resource and methodological framework for other human rights researchers and advocates on using open-source investigation techniques to conduct similar investigations. Should readers have interest in potential collaborations on further research or investigations, please do engage with us at info\@syrianarchive.org.
