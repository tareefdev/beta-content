On 19 September 2017, just four days after the [Astana International meeting establishing Syria's De-Escalation Zones](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/final-de-escalation-zones-agreed-astana-170915102811730.html) in many parts of the country, and only days after[the United Nations' Commission of Inquiry presented findings of a fact-finding](http://webtv.un.org/live-now/watch/commission-of-inquiry-on-the-syrian-arab-republic-press-conference/4473491386001) mission confirming the illegal use of chemical weapons and the systemic targeting of medical facilities by the Syrian government in April 2017, three Idlib medical facilities serving a combined more than 100.000 people yearly were allegedly attacked in airstrikes attributed to Syrian or Russian forces.

One of these facilities, the Rahme hospital in Khan Shaykhoun, was the same facility targeted with airstrikes in the immediate aftermath of the chemical attack on 4 April 2017. The Syrian Archive has [done in-depth open source analysis on this incident](https://syrianarchive.org/en/investigations/Medical-Facilities-Under-Fire/Incident-2.html). The Kafranbel hospital was also previously attacked [on March 25th 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgCm-W_gqM). All three facilities were far from conflict areas, and well within the designated [De-Escalation Zones established](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/final-de-escalation-zones-agreed-astana-170915102811730.html) as per an agreement between Russia, Turkey, and Iran.

This report presents in-depth overviews of visual content regarding the three incidents. To cross-reference findings from visual content, flight observation data was provided to the Syrian Archive by an organisation employing a well-developed network of spotters. By examining a variety of sources of information for each attack, the Syrian Archive was able to corroborate and strengthen findings. Visual content gathered and verified by the Syrian Archive was extensively analysed - including in-depth geolocation with satellite imagery. All times provided are in Damascus local time, and in 24-hour format.

Findings regarding these attacks were characterized by repeated bombardments, lack of warnings, and an absence of active military hostilities in the vicinity of the attack. Through collecting, verifying and reporting investigative findings from these incidents, the authors hopes to preserve critical information that may be used for advocacy purposes or as evidence in future proceedings seeking legal accountability.

\[Written on the wall "The health care center of Khan Shaykoun"\]

On 19 September 2017 between 11:00 and 11:45, the Rameh hospital in Khan Shaykhoun was attacked with airstrikes allegedly by Syrian airforce. The hospital served approximately 50.000 - 100.000 people. Khan Shaykoun Hospital was previously attacked on 4 April 2017, immediately after the chemical attack by sarin or a sarin-like substance, confirmed in a [report published by the OPCW.](https://www.opcw.org/fileadmin/OPCW/Fact_Finding_Mission/s-1510-2017_e_.pdf)

For the attack on 19 September, the [first video documenting the attack was published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAeBtlsiwfE) by Muaz Al Shami's, which showed destruction of the Khan Shaykoun hospital building, as well as fire inside the building. In the video, Al Shami stated: "Most of the hospital equipments have been destroyed. Tow ambulance cars have been destroyed too. The hospital is completely out of service now".\

Orient news video captured during the attack on 19-09-2017 compared to satellite images taken in 21-02-2017 and 02-06-2017

Hamah health directorate published a statement about the attack on [their facebook channel](https://www.facebook.com/HamaHealthDirectorate/photos/a.491994577596716.1073741829.473950772734430/1334949736634525/?type=3&theater) saying that the hospital was attacked at 11:00am on 19-09-2017 with two airstrikes which resulted in hospital building damage as well as its equipment and three ambulances.\
![19-09-kh-statement.png](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/flVQkjewmZj1rbvEQcwV3dbG-XOoseP08ZLmCDdxWcKx7QV2LyiZTFYBKoI15dRvHoHFlpyz2RBBE9ZcRT2HMi6YWHpXFwyUZuUcRnf3OlKAC22IMpiIysrgMT2daGdrNDscw7rN)\
Additional videos related to this attack are provided below

1.  Video from [Edlib Media Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbpy48dwNNE).

2.  Video from [Assi Press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_GaDzoTnHs).

To provide a further layer of verification, the Syrian Archive cross-referenced findings from the videos with flight observation data from a spotter organisation. This process necessitated analysing observation data for flights between 7:00 and 15:00, the period directly before and after the reported attack.

![mn-national-h1.jpg](/assets/19_sept_2017_-_2.width-800.png)\
Through comparing where flights were observed, the time they were observed, and the direction flights were heading, and comparing this data to geolocation conducted in earlier steps, the Syrian Archive was able to identify a flight potentially responsible for the attack (a fixed-wing Russian aircraft), seen circling the immediate vicinity of the geolocated attack site. Previous research has found that circling flights typically indicate target acquisition and/or preparation for imminent attack. Important to note is that while the aircraft type was Russian, it is possible the flight was operated by the Syrian airforce, rather than the Russian airforce, as the Syrian airforce also operates Russian planes.

Another staff member stated in the same video: "The destruction of the hospital included the Emergency department - X-Ray department - the infant department, the women's department, and the birth department. We moved one of the children from Altah hospital into the university hospital before the attack. We heard about the attack on Altah hospital while we were in the university hospital, so we came back to move the infants to Telmenes hospital and other medical facilities that are close to this area."

A panoramic image of the damaged hospital was created using stills from [Muaz Al Shami video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVd2AFqikhk). See below:

SMART News Agency [published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3zsuyum6QQ) showing the entrance to the hospital. In the same video, one of the hospital staff members stated in an interview: "We were working on an emergency case when the airstrike happened. We don't have injured from the medical staff but, one girl was injured in her back, as she was standing outside the hospital."

The Syrian Archive used frames from this video to create a panoramic view of the entrance to the hospital. See below:

Through comparing where flights were observed, the time they were observed, and the direction flights were heading, and comparing this data to geolocation conducted in earlier steps, the Syrian Archive was able to identify several flights potentially responsible for the attack (all fixed-wing Russian aircraft), seen circling the immediate vicinity of the geolocated attack site.
