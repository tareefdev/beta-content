The videos in this database have been collected by groups and individuals living or working in Syria. This collection would not be possible without those documenting and reporting on war crimes and crimes against humanity. Currently in this database there are 240 different sources, our thanks to each of them.  

The Syrian Archive would like to thank the student groups, in particular the Human Rights Center Investigations Lab, UC Berkeley, for their work verifying, annotating, and analysing videos. In particular we would like to thank: Youstina Youssef, Amy Choi, Anna Banchik, Annabell Brockhues, Ariela Levy, Carlos Sanchez, Caron Creighton, Charlotte Godart,  Elaria Youssef, Elise Baker, FÃ©lim McMahon, Greg Waters, Hannah Ellis, Manu Chaturvedi, Mariya Katsman, Michael Elsanadi, Monica Namo, Natalia Krapiva, Natalie Fowler, Rachel Thampapillai and Sarah Solieman.

This project was partially made possible by The Prototype Fund project of the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in 2016, volunteers and individual donations. To donate to the project, visit our Patreon page.
