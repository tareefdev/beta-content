Attacks using chemical weapons have been taking place in Syria since 2012. As of April 2018, official reports from the [French Foreign Ministry](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/170425_-_national_evaluation_annex_-_anglais_cle81722e.pdf) and the [Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic](http://www.ohchr.org/SiteCollectionImages/Bodies/HRCouncil/IICISyria/COISyria_ChemicalWeapons.jpg) put the number of chemical attacks at 163.

The Syrian Archive has documented **212** chemical weapon attacks through documentation efforts of individuals and groups in Syria. This Chemical Weapons Database, released on 24 April 2018, is the first publicly available collection of open source content documenting chemical weapon attacks in Syria between 2012 - 2018.

The collection contains documentation from over **190 sources** that can be viewed, analysed and downloaded. This process not only identified an additional 50 attack sites in Syria but brought together **861 verified videos** to corroborate these attacks.
