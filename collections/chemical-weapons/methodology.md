The Syrian Archive created a list of incidents based off publicly available research by the French Foreign Ministry, the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, findings from various OPCW fact-finding missions (including those by the OPCW-UN Joint Initiative Mechanism), and reports from civil society organisations (e.g. Human Rights Watch).

Syrian Archive staff sifted through its existing database of over 1.4 million videos to identify documentation of chemical attacks. Relevant videos were located and verified using the [Syrian Archive Digital Evidence Workflow](https://stage.syrianarchive.org/en/tools_methods) and metadata was extracted and standardised using an automated process and metadata scheme. Through undertaking this process, incidents not included on any of the reports mentioned above were uncovered.

For each of the 212 incidents identified, a detailed process of discovery was initiated. This process necessitated:
Extracting units from the Syrian Archive database about specific incidents using dates and locations;
Extracted units through specific geo-based areas;
Using content discovery tools for social media content such as [whopostedwhat.com](https://whopostedwhat.com).

Through adding context to data, the Syrian Archive transformed digital content to useful and searchable information with querying capabilities.

All content used in the building of this collection is open source and publicly derived, processed and published. The database places incidents on a map and allows data to be searched by incidents, keyword, and related video content.

While comprehensive in scope, there exist gaps in the collection. Some incidents are heavily documented while others are not. Continual updates of observations and incidents are planned, as well as inclusion of data from additional sources and publishing platforms (e.g. Twitter and Facebook).
