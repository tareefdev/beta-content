This Chemical Weapons Database contains **28 GB** of documentation of **212** chemical weapon attacks in Syria during the 2012-2018 period. This data comes from **193 sources** made up of individual citizen journalists, local and international media groups, as well as NGOs and civil society organisations. It is important to note that many if not all of these sources are partisan, and thus require caution with regards to their claims.

A total of 861 relevant videos documenting chemical weapon attacks were identified, the majority of which were published on YouTube. Additional documentation from Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms will be incorporated into the database in the coming months.
