The sheer amount of content being created, and the near constant removals of materials from public channels means that the Syrian Archive is in a race against time to preserve important documentation of crimes committed. Content preserved and verified by the Syrian Archive might offer the only evidence to corroborate witness testimonies of chemical weapons attacks, and to implicate potential perpetrators.

Of the 861 videos included in this dataset, 9% had been removed on YouTube. Due to Syrian Archive’s technical infrastructure and the constant monitoring of the status of videos and channels, the termination of affected content was brought to YouTube’s attention, resulting in 13 channels of media groups documenting chemical weapons attacks being reinstated in cases where users did not remove content willingly. One channel, “شبكة أحرار دوما - ريف دمشق,” by media reporters that had been documenting violations committed in Douma since 2012 has over 1.600 videos and one million views.
