International Humanitarian Law [prohibits the use of chemical munitions](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule74) in both international and non-international conflicts.

In 2013 the Syrian Arab Republic [ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention](http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_res_2118.pdf), following findings by the [Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](https://www.opcw.org/) that sarin had been used [on 21 August 2013](http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2013_553.pdf). In 2014, after an in-country mission, [OPCW reported they destroyed](https://www.opcw.org/news/article/opcw-all-category-1-chemicals-declared-by-syria-now-destroyed/) 100% of Category 1 chemicals by the Syrian Arab Republic and 70% of Syria’s Category 2 chemicals. They also reported destroying 94% of it’s declared chemical stockpile.

That chemical weapons were used in attacks attributed to the Syrian government after OPCW [destroyed chemical weapons stockpiles](https://www.opcw.org/fileadmin/OPCW/CSP/C-20/en/c2004_e_.pdf) indicates that either not all stockpiles were destroyed or that the Syrian government and non-governmental armed groups involved in the Syrian conflict (e.g. Daesh) acquired or manufactured chemical weapons after August 2013.

Syria had previously acceded to the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases and of [Bacteriological Methods of Warfare on 22 November 1968](http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_res_2118.pdf).

By examining the 212 incidents in which chemical weapons were used in the Syrian conflict since 2012 it becomes clear that their use is not infrequent or random but rather a repeated, deliberate and illegal [strategy of war](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/02/13/syria-coordinated-chemical-attacks-aleppo).
