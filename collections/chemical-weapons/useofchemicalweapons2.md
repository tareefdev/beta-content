The Syrian Archive has identified patterns in the use of chemical weapons its verified dataset. These include patterns include the use of chemical attacks by the Syrian army when trying to advance to control specific areas. Between 2013-2018 Jobar frontlines saw 12 chemical attacks.

Chemical attacks were also used by the Syrian army when forces not able to control specific areas after trying to advance, such as Kafr Zita 2014 and Aleppo 2016. Areas out of the control of the Syrian government also experienced chemical attacks perpetrated by the Syrian government, such as in Khan Shaykhun on 4 April 2017.

Analysis of the 861 verified videos indicates the types of chemicals used in some of the attacks. In 62 videos documentation of chlorine was observed. The effects of sarin can be observed in 372 videos. Containers and remnants of mustard gas were observed in four videos.

Through comparing a temporal analysis of chemical weapons attacks with territorial maps published by conflict monitoring groups (e.g. [liveuamap](https://syria.liveuamap.com/)), as well as information gathered through Syrian Archiveâ€™s networks, it becomes apparent that the majority of attacks occured in opposition controlled areas between 2012 and 2018.

----------------------

Syrian Archive has identified 85 unique locations which were attacked using chemical weapons. The Damascus countryside experienced the majority of chemical weapons attacks with 61 attacks documented. Idlib experienced 49 chemical weapons attacks. Aleppo and Hama experienced 33 and 29 chemical weapons attacks respectively. Homs experienced six chemical weapons attacks. Daraa experienced three chemical weapons attacks, and Deir Ezzor experienced one.

In their research of 130 chemical attacks, the [French Foreign Ministry](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/170425_-_national_evaluation_annex_-_anglais_cle81722e.pdf) attributed five chemical weapon attacks in which sarin was used to the Syrian government (five proven, two with strong presumption). The Foreign Ministry additionally claimed there was a strong presumption of chlorine used by the Syrian government in 22 incidents. Three chemical weapon attacks using mustard gas were also attributed by the Foreign Ministry to Daesh. The Foreign Ministry did not attribute 98 chemical attacks.

Syrian Archive provides corroborating open source content to findings published by the Organisation for the Prohibition of the Chemical Weapons, the UN Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, the French Foreign Ministry, and many Syrian human rights documentation groups with visual documentation [verified](https://stage.syrianarchive.org/en/tools_methods) by the Syrian Archive team, and does so in an publicly accessible format.

Visual documentation included in the Syrian Archive Chemical Weapons Database finds corroborating open source documentation for 103 of the 130 incidents published by the French Foreign Ministry. For 24 incidents included in French Foreign Ministry findings, the Syrian Archive was either unable to locate visual documentation or concluded that conventional weapons were at play, as of the date of publication. To give one example, the French Foreign Ministry reported a chemical attack on 6 September 2016 in Ein Terma and/or Jobar. After collecting and reviewing video documentation including testimony by medical workers treating those affected, the Syrian Archive concluded that suffocation was the result of conventional weapons rather than chemical weapons.

For ten incidents published by the French Foreign Ministry, the Syrian Archive provided specific locations where none were indicated. For example, Aleppo is noted as the location in 19 incidents, but the specific town and location were not provided.

The French Foreign Ministry additionally identified three reported chemical weapons attacks, claiming they took place on 25 April 2015 and 26 April 2015 (1- Sahl Al Ghab, 2- Hama, 3- Al Hawash). Through open source analysis, the Syrian Archive has concluded that these three incidents were in fact one incident which occurred on 26 April 2015 in Hawash, a village in Hama province. The Syrian Archive has identified two YouTube videos and eight Facebook posts, published from the location of the chemical attack, confirming these three incidents are in fact one.
