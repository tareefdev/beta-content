The Syrian Archive created the Chemical Weapons Database for a variety of audiences working on human rights monitoring in Syria. This includes journalists, who are be able to quickly find verified materials relating to hundreds of incidents, non-governmental organisations who use this material in their advocacy work, and lawyers, who use materials to seek accountability of perpetrators of these attacks.

 **Of importance to note is that much of the content contained in the database is highly graphic. It is recommended users take precautions in viewing material. **
