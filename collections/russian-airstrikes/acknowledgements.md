The videos in this database have been collected by groups and individuals in Syria.

This collection would not be possible without those documenting and reporting on war crimes and crimes against humanity. Currently in this database there are 116 different sources, our thanks to each of them.

Special thanks to everyone who helped in verifying, annotating and analysing videos.

In particular we would like to thank:
Mohammad Mhanna, Lilas Al Boni, Guevara Nabi, Ruba Akil, Nawar Mohra, Gretel and Gabi.
