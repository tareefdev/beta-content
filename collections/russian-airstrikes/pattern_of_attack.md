## Pattern of attacks against specifically protected persons and objects

Syrian Archive was able to identify a total of 205 unique incidents (433 videos) in which violations against specifically protected persons and objects resulted from alleged Russian airstrikes. The Syrian Archive discovered, preserved, and verified videos about those incidents.

A timeline of weekly alleged Russian airstrikes on Syrian civilians and civilian infrastructure is provided below:

This timeline shows since Russian involvement, alleged airstrikes have occurred consistently. During the September 2015 to February 2016 period, Russian airstrikes on civilian infrastructure were quite frequent. This was followed by a period between March 2016 and March 2017 in which attacks occurred on a less regular basis. In 2017, alleged Russian airstrikes increased and peaked during the April and September periods. During 2018, a alleged Russian airstrikes peaked during the first week of January and February.

Below is a table that summarises the number of incidents and videos per category between September 30th 2015 and September 09th 2018.

## Highlighted incidents

### Airstrikes against medical facilities

Much has been written about attacks targeting hospitals in Syria (e.g., UN OHCHR, SAMS, Physicians for Human Rights, Bellingcat, and many other organisations). For this reason, and in order to not duplicate findings, deeper analysis will not be provided in this report. Attacks against hospitals are illegal under International Humanitarian Law as they fall under the category of specially protected persons and objects. An analysis of 164 collected and verified videos by the Syrian Archive found a total number of 35 incidents in which hospitals were attacked.

#### Kafranbel Surgical Hospital

On 5 February 2018, local sources including Muaz Al Shami reported that Kafranbel Surgical Hospital (also known as Hand in Hand Hospital and Orient Hospital), was struck by multiple airstrikes resulting in significant material damage which caused the entire hospital to become completely out of service. Open source materials and flight observation data indicates this attack was conducted by the Russian air force.

Footage filmed during and after the 5 February 2018 attack clearly shows the hospital was attacked directly, with [one geolocated video capturing a bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFAjvqC9uw&list=PLPC0Udeof3T4QmV4f9tEhDmQzr2Z_vTKZ&index=1) as it fell through the air and struck the east side of the hospital building.

### Airstrikes against water sources

The Syrian Archive was able to identify 6 unique incidents in which water were attacked based on an analysis of 5 videos. All videos are available on the Syrian Archive website and a summary of relevant information (including metadata), is included in every incident.

The Russian Ministry of Defence released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKbA_g-4zEE) on their official YouTube channel with a title “Airstrike against oil refinery near Khafsa Kabir”.

![Russian MoD video](/assets/russian/Khafsa-Kabir-ru-youtube.png)

However, this “oil refinery” was actually a water treatment facility, which, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) representative in Syria, Hanaa Singer,  “produced an average of 18 million liters of water daily.” The structure shown in the airstrike video appears identical to Google Earth satellite imagery as shown below:

Russia Today published a video on 15 July 2017 in Arabic about the renovation operations of Khafsa water treatment facility.
