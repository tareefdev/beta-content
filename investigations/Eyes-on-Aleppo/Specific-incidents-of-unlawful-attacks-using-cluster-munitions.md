This section provides a summary of incidents identified by the Syrian Archive in analysis of its violation database. Incidents to be investigated include those where incendiary munitions were used, those in which cluster munitions were used unlawfully, and those against specifically protected persons and objects.

A table describing the date, location, reported civilian casualties, reported civilian injuries, type of munition used, and links to the video footage is provided in the Appendix of this report.

In-depth analysis of one incident occurring in the [Al Saleheen district of Aleppo city](https://www.google.de/maps/place/36%C2%B011'08.1%22N+37%C2%B009'34.2%22E/@36.1855833,37.158618,298m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d36.185583!4d37.159493?hl=en) on 9 July 2016 is provided below. For this investigation, videos and other open source materials shared online were used in order to understand the incident and verify the veracity of claims made about the attack. Similar in-depth analysis of other incidents involving cluster munitions described in the Appendix should be conducted, however time and capacity limitations meant that the Syrian Archive was unable to do so as of the date of publication.

## First moments of the 9 July 2016 Al Saleheen attack

On July 9, 2016, a video was published on YouTube by the user "احمد qwaszx احمد" which showed a large fire at the gas station of the Al Saleheen district as a result of an alleged Russian airstrike (as described in the video title). Sounds of ambulance cars at the nearby impact site can clearly be heard.

A second video the Syrian Archive collected and preserved was published on YouTube by the user "dibo madraty" on July 10, 2016. This second video mentions an attack targeting a gas station in Al Saleheen district, stating that workers might be in the gas station at the time of the attack. It is possible to, in this video, identify a minaret as well as smoke behind it as a result of an attack. It is also possible to hear the sound of the car ambulance, as in the case of the first video.

The Syrian Archive collected a photo of Al Salheen gas station [posted on Facebook in October 17, 2013](https://www.facebook.com/409669172457466/photos/a.415330965224620.94847.409669172457466/523157401108642/?type=3&theater). Comparing the photo found with the above first video, it becomes apparent that the gas station attacked in the first video is the same gas station as that of the photo found on Facebook.

We identified the roofs comparing the photo above with the videos we have found online.

A third video originally published by Halab News Network on July 9, 2016 and later preserved by the Syrian Archive, features an aircraft involved in the same Al Saleheen attack, as well as the attack's first moments.

A still of the aircraft allegedly used in the attack is provided below.

In this same video, it is possible to identify the bomb falling from the plane onto Al Saleheen, as visible on the still from the video below.

The Syrian Archive geolocated the position of the citizen journalist who filmed this video - he was first standing in a cemetery in front of \"[Maqam Ibrahim al Salihin,\" as the place is tagged on Wikimapia](http://wikimapia.org/35781586/Maqam-Ibrahim-al-Salihin).

Later, in the same video, the Syrian Archive geolocated another filming position based on the palm trees identified close to the impact site, as seen in the video still below:

![plane3](../../assets/plane3.png)

Below is a video and a satellite image that show both positions from the above photos.

This same video also shows members of the Syrian Civil Defence (more commonly known as \"the White Helmets') extinguishing the fire at the same gas station identified in the first video. This is visible on the still below.

Civilians, including children, are also seen running from the fire at the impact site in the same video, as seen in the following still.

On July 9, 2016, Aleppo Media Center additionally published a video on YouTube about the same attack. The Syrian Archive is able to determine this is the same attack due to the burned and damaged gas station appearing in the first video. See frames from video below:

## **Cluster munition model**

Through analysing multiple videos, the Syrian Archive was able to identify the specific cluster munition model used in the 9 July 2016 attack. In the same Aleppo Media Center video described above, a man is shown holding a [cluster submunition ShOAB-0.5](http://sovetarmy.2x2forum.com/t222-topic). See video frames below:

![p5](../../assets/p5.png)

The man in the video is heard saying: "There are injured people that we took to the hospital, and we don't know what is going to happen to them. Look at the bombs they are attacking us with, but we will keep staying in Aleppo."

![14](../../assets/14.png)

The Syrian Archive was able to determine c[luster submunition ShOAB-0.5](http://sovetarmy.2x2forum.com/t222-topic) were used based on diagrams of the munition [freely available online](http://fishki.net/1831321-chto-takoe-rbk-500-shoab-05.html/gallery-2955556/).

![15](../../assets/15.png)

"ShOAB" stands for Sharikovaya Oskolochnaya Aviatsionnaya Bomba, orspherical fragmentation aircraft bomb\", and describes the fragmentation (anti-personnel) effect of these submunitions. The ShOAB-0.5 is loaded into the RBK-500 ShOAB-0.5 cargo bomb, which contains a nominal 565 submunitions (+/- 5 pieces). Assembled, these bombs are 1950mm long, and weigh 334kg.

It should be noted that the diagram above shows a model without the aerodynamic fairing (nose cone). The bomb contains a central bursting charge for dispersing its payload. The ShOAB-0.5 bomblets themselves are derived from the US BLU-26 (and similar) series submunitions, and weigh approximately 417g each. They are 60mm diameter spheres, containing approximately 304 steel balls which act as shrapnel when dispersed by the 70g of TG-30 explosive compound (30% TNT, 70% RDX) contained within the cast steel shell. Several photos of RBK-500 SHAOB-0.5 bombs can be [seen in a Ruptly RT video on Su-24 bomber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCOtwT-KjQ).

## Geolocation of the attacked site

Analysing the photos and videos above, and, using Google Earth, the Syrian Archive was able to determine the [exact location](https://goo.gl/maps/93ATbUXb4rt) of the cluster munition impact site. See below:

We have also obtained a [video by IRT (Instant Reporting Team) which filmed Al Saleheen district](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0VXK9KRjlQ&feature=youtu.be&t=1m10s).

<iframe allowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e0VXK9KRjlQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The video shows the impact site, the mosque (in purple), the gas station (in blue), the roofs (in green), the building next to the mosque (in yellow) as well as the palm trees (in red).

Analysis of the munition remains above show that ShOAB-0.5 cluster bomb was used in an airstrike that targeted a civilian area, specifically a gas station, in the Al Saleheen district of Aleppo city on 9 July 2016. Alleged reports from the ground claimed this attack was carried by a Russian airstrike; journalists have previously found the SU-24 bombers at the Hmeim airbase engaged in the Syrian operation are armed with RBK-500 ShOAB-0.5 cluster bombs. Attribution to the Russian air force is not certain however, as the Syrian government began using this specific type of munition in the early years of the conflict [as of 2013 and continues to as of the date of this publication.](http://brown-moses.blogspot.de/2013/03/evidence-of-new-larger-cluster-bombs.html)
