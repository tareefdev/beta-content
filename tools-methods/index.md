desc: Open Source Tools and Methods for Open Source Investigations
---
The Syrian Archive strives for transparency in its tools, findings, and methodologies, as well as in making sure that verified content is publicly available and accessible for journalists, human rights defenders, and lawyers for reporting, advocacy and accountability purposes.

One of the ways this is done is through releasing all software developed publicly in free and open-source formats. This is done both to ensure trust is built and maintained between the Syrian Archive and its partners and collaborators, as well as to allow software to be reused and customised by other groups outside of this project. Technical integration with existing open-source investigative tools ensure that work is not duplicated.

We work in collaboration with other archival groups as well as lawyers and journalists to develop our methodology, and with other technologists to develop the open source tools we are using.
